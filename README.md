Larry's Block world, 3d reconstruction from 2d image

Most of this code is not mine, I just completed many of the lines for homework, including the code for all of the convolution filters and the code to get edge orientation and deciding on whether edges are horizontal or vertical

we can change the viewing angle at the end to view the 3d reconstructed scene in different ways using the line "ax.view_init(20, -120)"
